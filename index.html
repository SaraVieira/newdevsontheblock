        <p>
          Have you always wanted to build your own website but something held
          you back? Maybe because you thought you were not that techie after
          all? Then these two days are exactly for you! We take the first few
          steps down the web development road together and the best thing is

        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p>
          On day 1 (8:45-5) of your first dev adventure you’ll learn the basics
          of HTML and CSS and get the chance to build your very own website.
          With hands-on support from your badass coaches Sara, Eva, Klara and
          Nico and an awesome crew of like-minded people.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 2</h3>
        <p>
          On day 2 (9-5) it’s all about sharing insights about web development,
          finding the right resources to dive a little deeper and what can help
          if a career within the digital ecosystem doesn’t sound like too bad of
          an idea after all. Last but certainly not least, we want to put you in
          the center of these two days. So please bring all your questions and
          doubts and ask it away!
